The task is to go through each of these namespaces, make sure they're ported with tests and then check them off here as we go.

progress:
;; These all live inside of Hamiltonian. Or, they do now after I did that big
copy-pasta.

- [ ] canonical.scm (PR)

;; already done:
- [ ] rotation.scm

;; in PR:
- [ ] universal.scm
;; TODO
